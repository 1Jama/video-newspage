-tab nav for home page filtering, things like top headlines, or search 
-top headlines gets things like search, country[top headlines endpoint]
-search gets text field, dates, language [everything endpoint]
-maybe use sources endpoint to get languages and country to fill arrays, no0t that deep idk
-sources api has categories for top headlines endpoint
-can actually search terms for top headlines and everything i think everything is just when you wanna filter by date?
-add sortBy
-return 100 results and add pages
-everything does work with category just top headline
-i think i use everything endpoint to search and top headlines if theyre not searching maybe
